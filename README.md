# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Udacity Projects 

## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon 
Used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.  Performed statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations, acquire statistical knowledge for summarising data, and develop intuition around a data set.

## Data Wrangling 
Gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it as well as showcase my wrangling efforts through analyses and visualisations. 

## Create a Tableau Story
Created a Tableau data visualisation from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns on the data.
